## About Lara Stater

Lara Stater is an open source application for anyone, anywhere who wants to use it for personal, community, even industrial purposes.

Lara Stater was created with a way to create a website that is too monotonous or repetitive. With Lara Stater, this repetitive work is no longer necessary.

Why is that?
Of course in making a website if from the beginning what you need is:

-   Login and Register feature.
-   CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) data or files.
-   Role Management
-   Permissions Management
-   User Management
-   Website Settings Management
-   Activities on the website

By using Lara Stater you don't have to bother creating a website from 0 anymore. This is a revolution for the lay people!
